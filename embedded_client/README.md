## TODO
- Homescreen Buttons configurable by administrator(s)
    - Show/Hide based on role and tenant/site config


## CONFIG
The config directory contains the JSON files that define the device/tenant specific configuration for the application. These are built and shipped by the server when the device is joined to the environment and on first-time setup of the application. These values do not change during normal operation, and can only be changed by a configuration update pulled from the server.
